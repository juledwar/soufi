To release a new version of Soufi:

 1. Edit the changelog file and add the new revision (we should switch
    to setuptools-changelog, or reno). Commit the change as "Release 202.09.29" etc.
 2. Tag the current revision with the required release number, e.g.
    `git tag 2021.09.29`
 3. Build the package:
    `hatch build`
 4. Upload the package to testpyi first to make sure it is ok:
    `hatch run testpypi dist/*2021.9.29*`
 5. If that looks ok, upload to the real pypi:
    `hatch run pypi dist/*2021.9.29*`
 6. Push the new tag to Github:
    `git push origin 2021.09.29`
